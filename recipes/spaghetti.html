    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is a hard dish for me to talk about. I just cannot wrap my mind around how a dish so simple can be so delicious. There's a lot that I cannot wrap my mind around, really. I'm still confused on how the whole Enron thing went down. And what ever happened about all the Panama Papers investigations?

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 jar tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 package spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground sausage, onions, and garlic in a large pot or skillet with tall sides. Cook over medium heat until sausage is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Stir pasta sauce, water, and Italian seasoning into the pot; bring to a boil. Stir in spaghetti noodles, return to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are cooked through and sauce has thickened, 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
