Hello and welcome to my first project with the ~Odin Project~
This project will be a website of various recipes, showcasing my newfound 
prowess in HTML, as well as my increasing familiarity with the command line,
git, GitHub, and a bunch of other stuff as well (but mostly what I just mentioned).

By the end of the project, I will be able to make a big ole website chock full
of features, including colorful or non-colorful backgrounds, linked pages (both
relative and absolute), lovely images, clean code, and a healthy historical archive
of all the changes that occurred throughout in the form of all the commits on Git. 

I hope you are as excited as I am today to look back on this README and realize 
that you actually did all of this stuff! Wahooooooooooooooo
